# tic-tac-toe
Project: Tic Tac Toe (The Odin Project: JavaScript Course)

The first goal of the project was to get the game running in the console and then connect everything with an GUI.
This program uses the factory functions for most of the logic. I tried to have as less logic as possible outside
of the functions.
