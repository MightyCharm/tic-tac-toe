# tic-tac-toe
Project: Tic Tac Toe (The Odin Project: JavaScript Course)

First goal of the Project was, to get the game running in the console and then transfer everything into an GUI.
This program uses the factory functions "connectGUI", "game", "gameBoard" and "player" to keep everything running.
The factory function "game" is the heart of the program and keeps everything connected.
One more goal for this project is, to have as less global variables and functions as possible, everything should be inside the factory functions.

Currently I try to implement a responsive GUI and make the GUI a bit nicer to look at.
